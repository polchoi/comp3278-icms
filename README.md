# COMP3278 Intelligent Course Management System

## Project Descriptions
You are invited to develop an Intelligent Course Management System (ICMS) with a facial login component. It may have the following functions:
- When a student login with his/her face, his/her information such as name, login time, and welcome message will be presented in the graphics user interface (GUI).
- If the student has class within one hour, the corresponding course information, classroom address, teacherâ€™s message, links of Zoom, tutorial/lecture notes, other course materials and so on and so forth will be presented in the GUI. The student could click the links to redirect
to Zoom or other materials. The GUI should also allow the student to send the above information to his/her email address by email.
- If the student does not have class at the moment, the GUI could present a personal class timetable for the student.
- The system should record the latest behaviour of the student, such as when he/she logins the system, how long the student stays in the system, etc.
